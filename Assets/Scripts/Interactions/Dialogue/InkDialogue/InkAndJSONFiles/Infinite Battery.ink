Atlas, do you see the batteries over there? #layout:left #portrait:Handler #speaker:The Handler

As long as they haven't been damaged after the &!;;%;&&$, they will never run out of battery.

However, they run on geothermal energy. If their outer shells are damaged, they cannot function anymore. 

Any energy you put into those broken batteries will be drained away completely. You can't get it back.

Be careful, Atlas.
