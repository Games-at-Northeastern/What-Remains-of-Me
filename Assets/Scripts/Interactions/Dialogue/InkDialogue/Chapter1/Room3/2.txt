Hello Atlas, it's me again.#layout:left #portrait:default #speaker:The Handler
The virus infects the part of the lab you are in. The world at large has been struggling against this virus as well.
Luckily you have what it takes to save the world.
You are equipped with the latest antivirus, which allows you to detect the virus as purple particles on your energy meter.
If your energy becomes 100% corrupted, you will lose all control. Please be mindful when making connections to sources.
Good Luck。
