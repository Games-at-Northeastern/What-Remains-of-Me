Atlas, some of the doors you encounter aren't actually in need of energy. #layout:left #portrait:Handler #speaker:The Handler

They're equipped with sensors to detect how much energy you have before you enter. 

They were designed to keep maintenance bots well-charged - and to keep infected bots out.

Be sure to keep an eye on your energy level. We wouldn’t want you to get locked out of anywhere, now would we?
