Atlas, do you see the batteries over there? #layout:left #portrait:Handler #speaker:The Handler

As long as they haven't been damaged after &!;;%;&&$, they will never run out of battery.

They run on geothermal energy and will never run out.

If they're damaged, they're not functional anymore. 

Any energy you put into them will be drained away. You can't get it back.

Be careful, Atlas.
